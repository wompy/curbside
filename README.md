# curbside
To keep this simple I am using firefox so that no extra binary needs to be downloaded and a path specified. 

1. install dependency 'pip install selenium'
2. for for first test run <python curbside.py>
3. for the second test, run <python curbside_2.py> these files need to be in the same directory
